## Challenges We Faced

Throughout the development of PawnShop Galaxy, our team encountered several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and collaboration:

1.  **Database Integration:** Integrating the PostgreSQL database with our Express server proved to be more complex than anticipated. We faced issues with data consistency and had to restructure our database schema multiple times to ensure optimal performance.

2.  **Prisma as an ORM:** Adapting to Prisma as our ORM was a learning curve. While Prisma offers a lot of powerful features and a type-safe database client, understanding its nuances, especially in relation to raw SQL and optimizing certain queries, presented challenges. Additionally, integrating Prisma with our existing database setup and ensuring migrations were smooth required careful attention.

3.  **UI/UX Design:** Designing a user-friendly interface that also captured the essence of a galactic pawn shop was challenging. We went through several design iterations, gathering feedback from potential users, before finalizing our design.

4.  **State Management:** As our React application grew in complexity, managing state became a hurdle. We explored various state management solutions before settling on a combination of React's Context API and local component state.

5.  **Deployment:** Setting up continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions and Heroku presented its own set of challenges. We had to ensure that our environment variables were secure and that our application was scalable.

6.  **Team Collaboration:** Working in a remote environment required us to establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins. We utilized tools like Slack and Zoom to stay connected and ensure everyone was aligned with the project's goals.

Facing these challenges not only improved our technical skills but also strengthened our team's bond. We learned the importance of perseverance, open communication, and the value of constructive feedback.
