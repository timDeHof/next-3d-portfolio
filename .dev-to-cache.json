I built this all by myself.\n\n## About This Project\n\nAs an avid movie enthusiast, I have always been captivated by the enchanting world of cinema and the art of storytelling. I take great pleasure in exploring diverse genres, discovering emerging directors, and relishing the excitement of watching my beloved actors on the grand screen. Despite my passion for movies, the vast array of options often leaves me feeling overwhelmed and struggling to keep track of all the films that intrigue me. Therefore, I created a meticulously curated movie watchlist, featuring all the movies that have caught my eye, piqued my curiosity, or stirred my emotions.\n\nThe version I'm submitting for the Appwrite Hackathon is a work in progress and not the final version. My aim with this watchlist was to create a simple and efficient tool to keep track of my movie choices, create shareable viewing schedules, and ensure that I never forget a great film suggestion from my friends.\n\nTo facilitate a public demo, some features such as a shared viewing schedule are currently unavailable. However, I have implemented user authorization, which allows friends and family to access my watchlist and add their movie recommendations.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The main framework used to build the web app, including the client-side and server-side logic.\n\n- [React](https://react.dev/) - The main library used to build the UI components of the web app, including the search bar, movie cards, and watchlist.\n\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The main CSS framework used to style the UI components of the web app, providing a consistent style and layout.\n\n- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - The main HTTP client used to make API requests to the TMDB API, providing movie data to update the UI components with the movie information.\n\n- [Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/) - The main backend as a service platform used to store user watchlists, providing authentication, storage, and retrieval of watchlists.\n\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It was used to add type annotations to the codebase and catch type-related errors during development.\n\n- [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - a library used to generate unique identifiers. It was used to generate unique IDs for each movie in the watchlist.\n\n- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - a linter used to enforce coding standards and catch syntax errors. It was used to maintain code quality and consistency throughout the project.\n\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - a code formatter used to enforce a consistent code style. It was used to format the codebase according to a predefined set of rules.\n\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) - for automatic deployment from GitHub repo.\n\n## Challenges I Faced\n\nOne of the exciting challenges I encountered while working on this project was designing the database schema. Although I typically work with relational databases like Postgres, I had the opportunity to explore a new approach because Appwrite Cloud did not yet support relations at the time. This presented an opportunity to think creatively and design a general watchlist table that allowed all logged-in users to add movies to the watchlist. By embracing this challenge, I was able to expand my skills and learn new ways of approaching database design. I was able to come up with the following attributes\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686535529970/efb2d802-c9df-4f93-8d37-25dae1aae93b.jpeg)\n\nAnother exciting challenge I encountered while working on this project was implementing pagination for the TMDB API to fetch movie data for the keyword search. Although both the TMDB API and Appwrite's databases use page-based pagination to retrieve results, I had the opportunity to explore the different approaches and determine the best option for this project. With the TMDB API, the client must make additional API requests to retrieve additional pages of the results, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. However, with Appwrite databases, the client can use offset pagination or cursor pagination to divide data into discrete pages, which can be more efficient and user-friendly. After careful consideration, I decided to use offset pagination with Appwrite `Query.limit()` and `Query.offset()` functions, which allowed me to easily paginate the watchlist and present the data to the user in a user-friendly way. By embracing this challenge, I was able to expand my skills and learn new ways of approaching pagination in web development.\n\nIn conclusion, using Appwrite Cloud for your backend as a service needs can provide numerous benefits, such as easy user authentication, secure storage of user data, and efficient pagination of large datasets. With Appwrite's powerful API, you can easily integrate backend functionality into your web app, allowing you to focus on building a great user experience. By embracing the challenges of this project and using Appwrite Cloud, I was able to learn new approaches to database design and pagination that expanded my skills and improved the overall functionality of the web app. If you're interested in learning more about Appwrite Cloud and how it can benefit your project, I highly encourage you to visit their website and sign up for a free account today.\n\n## Public Code Repo\n\n[https://github.com/timDeHof/movie-nextjs-app](https://github.com/timDeHof/movie-nextjs-app)\n\nFeel free to poke around! This project was a learning experience, especially with typescript and next.js. By all means, submit a PR if you see something you think can be improved upon. I am never too afraid to learn something new.\n\n## Demo Link\n\n[https://reelwatch.vercel.app/](https://reelwatch.vercel.app/)\n\nTo access the movie database, users need to log in with their credentials. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and stored in the local storage, which initiates a session. To end the session, users can log out, which removes the token from the local storage. Adding movies to the watchlist is a breeze. Users can enter a search phrase in the search field to get a list of search results. After selecting a movie from the list, users can visit the movie's page, where they can add the movie to their watchlist or visit the movie's homepage. Once the process is complete, users are redirected back to the search page to continue searching. Please note that only 25 users are allowed to authenticate for this open-source demo. However, I have pre-populated the database with some of my favorite movies, so feel free to explore and enjoy.\n\n## Actionshots of the Reelwatch application\n\n### User Authorization:\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686532401247/9eb66508-52f3-4e8b-8a42-425d89c9ada8.gif)\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686532452743/f2d7b8aa-b56b-42da-8d4c-95d7e7833a45.gif)\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686532494367/d09e48f2-4028-4ca9-849d-89e00edfa175.gif)\n\n### Search for movies:\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/lMjZFyX1cdpISnFMhn/giphy.gif)\n\n### Add a movie to your watchlist:\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xGb40Uj8thK1dgPuOA/giphy.gif)\n\n### Find it in the Watchlist:\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/7R5KQpK7ijulQePE15/giphy.gif)\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nAs the developer of ReelWatch, I'm thrilled to share this meticulously curated movie watchlist with fellow movie enthusiasts. The app provides a simple and efficient tool for tracking movie choices, creating shareable viewing schedules, and ensuring that great film suggestions are never forgotten. While the app is still a work in progress and needs some refinement, I'm excited to continue improving it.

It's designed to work with APIs and handle network requests in a way that makes it easy for developers to build scalable and fast web applications. But sometimes things don't go as planned, and unexpected bugs can arise. In this post, we'll take a look at a common issue that can occur when using React Query and show you how to debug and solve it.\n\n## The Problem\n\nImagine you have a React component that uses React Query to fetch data from an API and display it. You're getting the data for page 2 of the API, but for page 3, the data is missing. In the network tab of your browser's dev tools, you see that the response for page 3 is an empty array, but the response for page 2 is correct. This is a common issue that can occur when using React Query, and it can be difficult to determine the root cause.\n\n## Debugging the Issue\n\nThe first step in debugging this issue is to take a look at the code that's making the API call. In our case, it's the `getIssues` function. This function is using the `axios` library to make the API request and pass the response to React Query.\n\n```\nexport async function getIssues(\n  page: number,\n  projectId?: string | undefined,\n  options?: { signal?: AbortSignal }\n) {\n  const { data } = await axios.get<Page<Issue>>(ENDPOINT, {\n    params: projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page },\n    signal: options?.signal,\n  });\n\n  if (projectId === undefined) {\n    return data;\n  } else {\n    data.items = data.items.filter((item) => item.projectId === projectId);\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n\n```\n\nAs you can see from the code above, the function is using the `projectId` parameter to filter the results. If the projectId is not specified, the function returns the raw data with no filtering. However, if the projectId is specified, the function filters the data to only include objects with a matching projectId. There are several approaches that you can use to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Verify the API request: Ensure that the API endpoint URL and the request parameters are correct. You can use tools such as Postman to make API requests and check the response.\n\n2. Inspect API response: Use the browser's DevTools to inspect the API response and check if it contains the expected data.\n\n3. Debug the API call: You can add logging statements or breakpoints in your code to track the API request and response.\n\n4. Check API status: Verify that the API is up and running and that you have the necessary permissions to access the data.\n\n5. Try a different API endpoint: If the API request returns an unexpected result, try a different endpoint or API to get the data.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that the API response might be correct, and the issue could be with the way the data is processed or displayed in the frontend. In this case, you might need to debug the front-end code or check the data structures and types in your code.\n\nAnyway, I chose to add logging statements to the code to track the API request and response. Here are some logging statements that I added to help debug my `getIssues` function:\n\n1. Logging the URL and the parameters being passed to `axios.get` to make sure that the correct URL and parameters are being used.\n\n```\nconsole.log(`URL: ${ENDPOINT}`);\nconsole.log(`Params: ${JSON.stringify(projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page })}`);\n\n```\n\n1. Logging the response object and the error object to see if the API call is returning the expected data or if there are any errors.\n\n```\nconsole.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);\nconsole.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);\n\n```\n\n1. Logging the value of `projectId` to make sure it is the value I expected.\n\n```\nconsole.log(`projectId: ${projectId}`);\n\n```\n\nThese statements will give me more information about what is happening in the function and hopefully help me to identify the issue.\n\n```\nexport async function getIssues(\n  page: number,\n  projectId?: string | undefined,\n  options?: { signal?: AbortSignal }\n) {\n  const { data } = await axios.get<Page<Issue>>(ENDPOINT, {\n    params: projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page },\n    signal: options?.signal,\n  });\n  console.log(`URL: ${ENDPOINT}`);\n  console.log(`projectId: ${projectId}`);\n  console.log(`Params: ${JSON.stringify(projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page })}`);\n  console.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(data.items)}`);\n  console.error(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(Error)}`);\n\n  if (projectId === undefined) {\n    console.log('items: ', data.items)\n    return data;\n  } else {\n    data.items = data.items.filter((item) => item.projectId === projectId);\n    console.log(\"filtered items: \", data.items)\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n\n```\n\nBy examining the console in the dev tools, I discovered that `projectId` for page 2 is undefined, whereas `projectId` for page 3 is blank or an empty string.\n\n## Solution\n\nAfter examining the code, it's clear that the issue is related to the `if (projectId === undefined) { return data; }` statement. This statement only returns the data if the `projectId` is undefined, but what if it's an empty string? In this case, it would be handled by the `else { data.items = data.items.filter((item) => item.projectId === projectId); }` statement, which made the empty string go through the filtering step and setting the `data.items` response to an empty array for page 3.\n\nTo fix this issue, I needed to update the `if` statement to return the data if the `projectId` value is either undefined or an empty string.\n\n```\nif (projectId === undefined || projectId === '') { return data; }\n\n```\n\nWith this change, the `getIssues` function will now return the data in both cases, even if the `projectId` is an empty string. In addition, I was able to render the data on the website and pass the end-2-end testing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, debugging an issue with an empty response from an API call can be a challenging task, especially when the issue is in the data retrieval function. However, by using the appropriate logging statements and carefully examining the logs, we were able to identify the root cause of the issue and resolve it by updating our code.\n\nAs a self-learner, this experience has taught me the importance of being able to effectively debug issues and the value of having a systematic approach when solving problems. I hope this post has been helpful to those who are also looking to improve their debugging skills and that it has inspired you to continue learning and growing as a developer.Happy coding!\n\nIf you found this post helpful, I would love to hear from you!

Here are some logging statements that I added to help debug my <div>getIssues</div> function:</div>\n\n\n<div>\n<div>Logging the URL and the parameters being passed to <div>axios.get</div> to make sure that the correct URL and parameters are being used.</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div><div>console.log(`URL: ${ENDPOINT}`);\nconsole.log(`Params: ${JSON.stringify(projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page })}`);\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div>\n<div>Logging the response object and the error object to see if the API call is returning the expected data or if there are any errors.</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div><div>console.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);\nconsole.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div>\n<div>Logging the value of <div>projectId</div> to make sure it is the value I expected.</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div><div>console.log(`projectId: ${projectId}`);\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div>These statements will give me more information about what is happening in the function and hopefully help me to identify the issue.</div>\n\n\n<div><div>export async function getIssues(\npage: number,\nprojectId?: string | undefined,\noptions?: { signal?: AbortSignal }\n) {\nconst { data } = await axios.get&#x3C;Page&#x3C;Issue>>(ENDPOINT, {\nparams: projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page },\nsignal: options?.signal,\n});\nconsole.log(`URL: ${ENDPOINT}`);\nconsole.log(`projectId: ${projectId}`);\nconsole.log(`Params: ${JSON.stringify(projectId ? { page, projectId } : { page })}`);\nconsole.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(data.items)}`);\nconsole.error(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(Error)}`);\n\nif (projectId === undefined) {\nconsole.log('items: ', data.items)\nreturn data;\n} else {\ndata.items = data.items.filter((item) => item.projectId === projectId);\nconsole.log(\"filtered items: \", data.items)\n}\nreturn data;\n}\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div>By examining the console in the dev tools, I discovered that <div>projectId</div> for page 2 is undefined, whereas <div>projectId</div> for page 3 is blank or an empty string.</div>\n\n\n<div>Solution</div>\n\n\n<div>After examining the code, it's clear that the issue is related to the <div>if (projectId === undefined) { return data; }</div> statement. This statement only returns the data if the <div>projectId</div> is undefined, but what if it's an empty string? In this case, it would be handled by the <div>else { data.items = data.items.filter((item) => item.projectId === projectId); }</div> statement, which made the empty string go through the filtering step and setting the <div>data.items</div> response to an empty array for page 3.</div>\n\n\n<div>To fix this issue, I needed to update the <div>if</div> statement to return the data if the <div>projectId</div> value is either undefined or an empty string.</div>\n\n\n<div><div>if (projectId === undefined || projectId === '') { return data; }\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div>With this change, the <div>getIssues</div> function will now return the data in both cases, even if the <div>projectId</div> is an empty string. In addition, I was able to render the data on the website and pass the end-2-end testing.</div>\n\n\n<div>Conclusion</div>\n\n\n<div>In conclusion, debugging an issue with an empty response from an API call can be a challenging task, especially when the issue is in the data retrieval function. However, by using the appropriate logging statements and carefully examining the logs, we were able to identify the root cause of the issue and resolve it by updating our code.</div>\n\n\n<div>As a self-learner, this experience has taught me the importance of being able to effectively debug issues and the value of having a systematic approach when solving problems. I hope this post has been helpful to those who are also looking to improve their debugging skills and that it has inspired you to continue learning and growing as a developer.Happy coding!</div>\n\n\n<div>If you found this post helpful, I would love to hear from you!

In this post, I'll share my insights on object-oriented programming, code style and formatting, and exception handling in Java.\n\n## Object-Oriented Programming\n\nJava is an object-oriented language, where entities and their properties are represented as objects. It also follows the SOLID principles, a set of five guidelines for creating maintainable and scalable software. In contrast, JavaScript is a prototype-based language that uses objects as blueprints for creating new objects.\n\n```java\npublic class Dog {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n\n    public Dog(String name, int age) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n}\n```\n```javascript\nclass Dog {\n    constructor(name, age) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    getName() {\n        return this.name;\n    }\n\n    getAge() {\n        return this.age;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n### A few key differences between Java and JavaScript include:\n\n1. **Class Declaration:** Java classes are declared with the `class` keyword, while JavaScript classes use the `class` keyword from ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).\n\n2. **Constructors:** Java constructors are declared with the `public` keyword, followed by the class name and constructor arguments. In JavaScript, constructors are declared with the `constructor` keyword and constructor arguments.\n\n3. **Access Modifiers:** Java has access modifiers, such as `private`, to control the visibility of class members. JavaScript doesn't have access modifiers, but the `_` (underscore) prefix is often used to indicate private properties.\n\n4. **Methods:** Both Java and JavaScript use the `function` keyword to declare methods. In Java, methods are declared inside the class, while in JavaScript, methods are declared inside the class using the `methodName()` syntax.\n\nIt's essential for a JavaScript developer transitioning to Java to understand these differences in class declaration, constructors, access modifiers, and method declaration.\n\n## Code Style and Formatting\n\nThe Java Community Process defines a well-established coding standard for Java, which includes format, naming conventions, and other coding principles. Adhering to this standard ensures readable, manageable, and consistent code. Java also requires Javadoc comments, concise documentation for classes, methods, and variable definitions.\n\nIn comparison, JavaScript doesn't have a strict coding standard, although it does have widely accepted code style guides like the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/). These guides provide recommendations for code formatting and naming conventions, but they are not as strictly enforced as the Java coding standard.\n\nBy following a strict coding standard and focusing on code readability and maintainability, Java development prioritizes high-quality, well-organized code. This is especially important for large projects where code maintenance and updates are crucial.\n\n## Exception Handling\n\nJava has a robust exception handling mechanism to handle errors and exceptions in a program. In contrast, JavaScript relies on try-catch blocks or custom error objects to handle errors, which can become complex in larger projects with multiple errors. Java provides a range of built-in exceptions and encourages developers to catch and handle exceptions as early as possible.\n\nHere's an example of Java's built-in exceptions:\n\n```java\npublic class ExceptionExample {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    try {\n      int result = divide(10, 0);\n      System.out.println(result);\n    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n      System.out.println(\"Cannot divide by zero!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  private static int divide(int a, int b) {\n    return a / b;\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the `divide` method checks if the denominator `b` is equal to zero, and if so, it throws an `ArithmeticException` when the divisor `b` is zero. The exception is then caught in the `main` method using a `try-catch` block. The catch block handles the exception by printing a user-friendly error message, that includes the exception message that was thrown in the `divide` method.\n\nAnd here's an example of error handling in JavaScript:\n\n```javaScript\nfunction divide(a, b) {\n  if (b === 0) {\n    throw new Error(\"Cannot divide by zero!\");\n  }\n  return a / b;\n}\n\ntry {\n  let result = divide(10, 0);\n  console.log(result);\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(error.message);\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the divide() function will throw a custom error when the divisor `b` is zero. The `try-catch` block will catch this error and print the error message.\n\nI hope these examples give you a better understanding of the differences between Java and JavaScript's exception handling mechanisms.\n\n## Learning Resources\n\nLearning a new programming language can be an exciting, but challenging experience. Here are a few resources that can help you on your journey to learning Java:\n\n1. [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/): The official Java documentation is a comprehensive resource that covers all aspects of the language, from the basics to advanced topics. It's a great place to start for anyone new to Java.\n\n2.

Some popular options include \"[Head First Java](https://amzn.to/3kPDTiP)\" and \"[Effective Java](https://amzn.to/3Hr6Ycf)\", Which can be found on Amazon.\n\n4. Java Community: The Java community is large and vibrant, with many forums and resources available to help you learn and troubleshoot. Consider joining online communities, such as Stack Overflow, for additional support.\n\nThese resources can help you get started on your journey to learning Java, but the most important thing is to keep practicing and building your skills. Good luck!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, Java and JavaScript are both influential and commonly utilized programming languages, yet they possess significant distinctions in terms of programming methods, code style and formatting, exception handling and type systems. Java boasts a strong and standardized development environment that prioritizes code comprehensibility, upkeep and stability, while JavaScript affords a more adaptable and dynamic ecosystem that enables more imaginative and pioneering development. As a JavaScript developer moving to Java, it is crucial to comprehend these differences and familiarize oneself with the standard practices and conventions applied in Java development.\n\nIn conclusion, embrace the learning process of transitioning from JavaScript to Java and experience the benefits of Java's robust and standardized development environment.

But when I decided to make a career change and become a full-stack developer, I faced a whole new set of challenges and opportunities.\n\n## Seeking the One True Coding Bootcamp\n\nI set out on a quest to find the one true coding bootcamp that would guide me on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I spent many long hours scouring the land, researching different options and seeking the counsel of wise mentors. Finally, I found the path that seemed right for me and I enrolled in the program, determined to master the skills and technologies I needed to succeed. The road ahead was steep and challenging, but I was resolute in my purpose and I threw myself into the program with all my might. Through hard work and determination, I began to develop the skills I needed to embark on my new career.\n\n## Mastering the Technologies of Web Development\n\n<img width=\"100%\" style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZQCRCYU6t8HmM/giphy.gif\">\n\nDuring my time at the coding bootcamp, I set out on a quest to master the various languages and technologies involved in full-stack development. Through diligent study and practice, I was able to quickly get up to speed on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the essential front-end technologies that are used to build the user interface of a web application.\n\nBut my journey did not end there. I also delved into the deeper mysteries of server-side development, learning about powerful technologies such as Express.js and Node.js. These languages required a deeper understanding of concepts such as databases and APIs, but with the guidance of my instructors and the aid of my fellow travelers, I was able to master them as well.\n\nAlong the way, I encountered many useful tools and frameworks that helped me on my journey. One such tool was React.js, a powerful library for building user interfaces. With its help, I was able to create dynamic and interactive web applications that truly impressed my peers.\n\nOverall, I feel that the coding bootcamp was a great adventure that helped me master the technologies and skills needed to be a successful full-stack developer. I am confident that the knowledge and experience I gained will serve me well as I continue my journey through the tech industry.\n\n## Project Work in the Coding Bootcamp\n<img width=\"100%\" style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/RlZO2mKipB3u8/giphy.gif\">\n\nDuring the coding bootcamp, I had the opportunity to undertake a great quest: the creation of a full-stack e-commerce website project, which we called Galactic Pawn. This project was a group capstone, designed to test our skills and simulate a remote team environment. We used the web development and full-stack technologies we had learned in the program to build the website, wielding powerful tools such as React, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL. Later, I successfully deployed the website to [Render.com](http://Render.com) and the database to [Bit.io](http://Bit.io), using the magic of Prisma and JWT.\n\nThe website included a login and registration page, as well as a main store page that allowed users to create an account and add items to their cart. One of the challenges of the project was integrating all of the different routes and technologies to create a cohesive and functional website. However, with the help of our wise instructors and by working effectively as a team, we were able to overcome this challenge and complete the project to the satisfaction of all.\n\nIf you'd like to see the results of our labors, you can check out the live demo [here](https://capstone-galactic-pawn.onrender.com/) or view the Git repo [here](https://github.com/PawnShop-at-the-end-of-the-galaxy/PawnShop-Galaxy). This group capstone project was a great opportunity for us to apply the skills and knowledge we had gained during the coding bootcamp and work collaboratively with our fellow classmates. I am proud of what we were able to accomplish together and grateful for the experience.\n\n## The Search for the Full-Stack Developer Role\n<img width=\"100%\" style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/HVr4gFHYIqeti/giphy.gif\">\n\nUpon graduating from the coding bootcamp, I set out on a quest to find a full-stack developer role. I knew this would be no easy feat, as I was new to the field and would face many challenges along the way.\n\nI began by updating my resume and LinkedIn profile, polishing them like a shining sword for the battles ahead. I also reached out to my connections in the tech industry, seeking any leads or guidance that might aid me on my journey.\n\nI applied for a variety of roles, from entry-level positions to more experienced developer roles. The job search process can be a treacherous path, but I was determined to find the right opportunity.\n\nOne thing that helped me stand out to potential employers was my background as a mechanical design engineer.
